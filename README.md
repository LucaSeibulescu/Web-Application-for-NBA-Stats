Project: NBA Stats Analyst


About the Project: 
- This is a relational database project which gives the users a scope of how NBA league and its members behave and how do they relate to each other.
The database is created to store various information about teams/players/coaches/team owners that belong in the NBA. There are two user groups that can use the database: admin and fan. Both admin and fan can perform select/insert/update/delete operations on the database information and the only difference is that admin can delete fans on the control panel.
